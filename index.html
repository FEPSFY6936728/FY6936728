Graphene, often called a "wonder material", has garnered immense attention due to its extraordinary properties and potential 
        applications across fields such as sensors, neural electrodes, energy storage devices, and nanocomposites (Singh et al, 2011). 
        But what exactly is graphene, and why has it sparked such excitement?

<b><u>Electronics and Semiconductors</u></b>
Graphene’s potential in electronics comes from its high carrier mobility, which allows electrons to move quickly through the material, enabling 
        faster devices (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). Its ambipolar electric field effect improves flexibility in circuits, and ballistic transport 
        at room temperature makes graphene suitable for high-speed electronics (Schwierz, 2010). The Chiral Quantum Hall Effect (CQHE) in graphene 
        exhibits half-integer steps in conductivity, due to the unique way electrons behave, mimicking relativistic particles (Novoselov et al, 2005). 
        This quantum behaviour provides precise control of electronic properties, crucial for quantum computing. Furthermore, graphene’s minimum quantum 
        conductivity near the neutrality point allows it to remain conductive even when charge carriers are sparse, unlike conventional semiconductors.

<b><u>Energy Storage Applications</u></b>
Graphene’s high surface area and excellent conductivity make it perfect for enhancing energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries 
        and supercapacitors (Bonaccorso et al, 2015). In batteries, graphene improves charge capacity by allowing more efficient ion interaction, 
        leading to faster charging, more storage, and longer-lasting performance without degradation. In supercapacitors, the ability to handle rapid charge 
        and discharge cycles are vital for high-power applications, such as electric vehicles (Bonaccorso et al, 2015). Additionally, graphene’s flexibility and 
        strength could lead to lighter, more durable energy storage devices, enhancing the performance of portable electronics and renewable energy systems.

<b><u>Biomedical Applications</u></b>
Graphene’s biocompatibility opens the door to various medical applications (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). Its ability to penetrate cells 
        efficiently makes it ideal for targeted drug delivery, where drugs can be attached to graphene nanoparticles and delivered precisely 
        to diseased cells, minimising side effects (oncology treatments). Graphene-based biosensors are highly sensitive, allowing for real-time 
        detection of biomolecules, which is essential for early disease diagnosis and health monitoring (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). In addition, 
        graphene’s optical properties make it suitable for enhancing medical imaging technologies, offering higher-resolution images in techniques like MRI. 
        Researchers are also exploring graphene’s potential in tissue engineering, where its conductivity could promote cell growth and aid in tissue 
        regeneration, such as in nerve or bone tissues.

<b><u>Scalability Issues</u></b>
Scalability remains one of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of graphene. Producing large quantities of high-quality graphene that retain 
    the material's exceptional properties are complex and costly. Initially, graphene was isolated using mechanical exfoliation, a process that, while effective 
    for research purposes, is not scalable due to its labor-intensive nature and low yield. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) has emerged as a promising technique for 
    producing large-area graphene. In this process, a carbon-containing gas, such as methane, is decomposed on a heated metal substrate, resulting in the formation of 
    graphene layers. Bae et al (2010) demonstrated the potential of CVD by producing 30-inch graphene films using a roll-to-roll method, marking a significant advancement 
    toward large-scale production. However, ensuring uniform quality over large areas remains challenging, as defects and grain boundaries can significantly impact 
    the material's electrical and mechanical properties. Liquid-phase exfoliation is another scalable technique that has attracted attention. Paton et al (2014) developed a 
    method for producing defect-free few-layer graphene through shear exfoliation in liquids. This technique involves exfoliating graphite in a liquid medium, producing 
    graphene flakes that can be scaled up for industrial applications. Despite its scalability, the quality of graphene produced through this method can be 
    inconsistent, with variations in flake size and thickness. Another method, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide (SiC), involves heating SiC to high temperatures, causing 
    the silicon to sublimate and leaving behind a graphene layer on the carbon surface. This technique produces high-quality graphene with excellent electronic properties but is 
    limited by the cost and availability of SiC wafers and the difficulty in achieving large-area coverage (Yu et al, 2011).

    
<b><u>Cost of Production</u></b>
The cost of producing graphene, especially high-quality graphene, remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption. Methods that produce 
    the highest quality graphene, such as CVD and epitaxial growth on SiC, require expensive equipment and precise control over growth conditions, driving up 
    costs. For instance, CVD requires metal substrates like copper, which must be carefully prepared and subsequently removed, adding to the overall expense. 
    Liquid-phase exfoliation, while less costly and more scalable, often produces lower-quality graphene. The trade-off between cost and quality is a critical 
    challenge for the commercialization of graphene, as industries require both high-quality and cost-effective materials (Paton et al, 2014).
