                            Quantum computing is a cutting-edge field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally new ways.
                            Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
                            This allows them to solve certain complex problems—like optimization and cryptography—much faster than traditional computers.

                        Quantum computing is an emerging technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics—such as superposition 
                        and entanglement—to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Unlike traditional bits, 
                        quantum bits (qubits) can represent multiple states simultaneously, enabling faster and more efficient processing for complex problems. 
                        This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, drug discovery, climate modeling, and artificial intelligence. 
                        By exponentially increasing computational power, quantum computing could accelerate innovation and transform industries across the globe 
                        (Arute et al., *Nature*, 2019; IBM Quantum, 2024).
