Graphene, often called a "wonder material", has garnered immense attention due to its extraordinary properties and potential 
        applicatios across fields such as sensors, neural electrodes, energy storage devices, and nanocomposites (Singh et al, 2011). 
        But what exactly is graphene, and why has it sparked such excitement?

Electronics and Semiconductors:
Graphene’s potential in electronics comes from its high carrier mobility, which allows electrons to move quickly through the material, enabling 
        faster devices (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). Its ambipolar electric field effect improves flexibility in circuits, and ballistic transport 
        at room temperature makes graphene suitable for high-speed electronics (Schwierz, 2010). The Chiral Quantum Hall Effect (CQHE) in graphene 
        exhibits half-integer steps in conductivity, due to the unique way electrons behave, mimicking **relativistic particles** (Novoselov et al, 2005). 
        This quantum behaviour provides precise control of electronic properties, crucial for quantum computing. Furthermore, graphene’s minimum quantum 
        conductivity near the neutrality point allows it to remain conductive even when charge carriers are sparse, unlike conventional semiconductors.

Energy Storage Applications:
Graphene’s high surface area and excellent conductivity make it perfect for enhancing energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries 
        and supercapacitors (Bonaccorso et al, 2015). In batteries, graphene improves charge capacity by allowing more efficient ion interaction, 
        leading to faster charging, more storage, and longer-lasting performance without degradation. In supercapacitors, the ability to handle rapid charge 
        and discharge cycles is vital for high-power applications, such as electric vehicles (Bonaccorso et al, 2015). Additionally, graphene’s flexibility and 
        strength could lead to lighter, more durable energy storage devices, enhancing the performance of portable electronics and renewable energy systems.

Biomedical Applications:
Graphene’s biocompatibility opens the door to various medical applications (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). Its ability to penetrate cells 
        efficiently makes it ideal for targeted drug delivery, where drugs can be attached to graphene nanoparticles and delivered precisely 
        to diseased cells, minimising side effects (oncology treatments). Graphene-based biosensors are highly sensitive, allowing for real-time 
        detection of biomolecules, which is essential for early disease diagnosis and health monitoring (Geim and Novoselov, 2007). In addition, 
        graphene’s optical properties make it suitable for enhancing medical imaging technologies, offering higher-resolution images in techniques like MRI. 
        Researchers are also exploring graphene’s potential in tissue engineering, where its conductivity could promote cell growth and aid in tissue 
        regeneration, such as in nerve or bone tissues.
